# Smart Lamp with IoT Technology
My Smart Lamp detects movement in the area, temperature and humidity. The Lamp also has an additional features for safety, the security mdoe. When activated if movement is detected in the area, an alarm will go off, alerting the owner to the burgalrs presence. If the security mode isn't activated and movement is detected in the room, the lamp will turn on.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
I completed all of the electronics including triggers, notifications, sensors and a LED light. The PIR sensor detects infrared, which detects movement around the area. The IDR sensor detects the light level around the room and if it is below a certain level, it will turn on the Neopixel LED ring. The neopixel LED ring can change colors using sliders on the cayenne dashboard. The DHT11 sensor senses the temperature and humidity around the room. If the temperature and humidity are too high or low, a notification will be sent to the owner. There are also 2 other buttons on the cayenne dashboard, the burglar mode, which, if pressed, will detect movement in the room and send a notification to the owner. But when the button is not activated and movement is detected in the room, the lamp will turn on. The False Safe button in case there is a false alert when the burglar mode is turned on.

# Useless Machine

The useless machine is well, useless. It uses a switch that triggers a LED light (green) and the movement of the arm. When the arm hits the switch, flipping it, the LED turns red, and the arm reverses directions. Eventually, the base of the arm hits a snap switch, which turns off the whole circuit. The switch connects to the motor and battery through 2 sets of green pins.
